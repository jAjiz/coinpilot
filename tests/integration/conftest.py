"""Fixtures for the tests that need a real PostgreSQL.

Every one of them is skipped unless RUN_DB_INTEGRATION is true, so a developer with no
database still runs the unit suite.

Reading DATABASE_URL here is deliberate, and it is not what the global rule forbids: it
says where the test runs, not what the code under test is given.
